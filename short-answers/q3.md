# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users';
  const users = await fetch(url)
    .then((r) => r.json())
    .catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users);
  return users;
};
getUsers();
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

(By the way, Prettier changed how the code looks.)

This code is going to work because it follows the structure of an async/await fetching function. It is done by having `async` in line 6. Then, in the line where users are created, we fetch and wait for the response of `await fetch(url)`. If the response is ok, then the data (`r`) will be formatted into a JSON. Lastly, when errors are caught, an empty array would be returned. This is all returned with `users` being returned and the function being evoked.
