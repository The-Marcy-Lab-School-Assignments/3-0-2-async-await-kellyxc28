# Question

Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

They are more readable because they do similar actions with lesser code. Lesser code occurs when callbacks and chaining from the `then`s of a `Promise` are not needed.
